                    Hi there, my name is Connor and I am a web development student at Houston Coding Bootcamp. I was born and raised in Houston
                    TX and somehow never got tried of the year around one hundred percent humidity. I first became interested
                    in web development after my older brother showed me the dev tools in Google Chrome when I was younger.
                    I realized that with only a few lines of code and an understanding of what was possible, I could make
                    anything I wanted. </p>

                <p> When I am is not writing code, I am often prepping to DM a weekly game of Dungeons & Dragons for my friends.
                    Some of my other hobbies include: graphic design, cycling, reading, and drinking good coffee.</p>
